# A deadlock:-
- occurs in a database system when two or more transactions cannot proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a lock. 
- This creates a cycle of dependencies, leading to a situation where no transaction can move forward. 
- In Laravel, as with any other database application, deadlocks can happen if proper precautions and strategies are not in place.

## Here's a simple example of how a deadlock might occur in Laravel:
### Transaction 1

    DB::beginTransaction();
    try {
        $user1 = User::find(1);
        $user1->update(['balance' => $user1->balance - 100]);
    
        // Simulate a delay or additional work
        sleep(5);
    
        $user2 = User::find(2);
        $user2->update(['balance' => $user2->balance + 100]);
    
        DB::commit();
    } catch (\Exception $e) {
        DB::rollback();
        // Handle the exception
    }

### Transaction 2

    DB::beginTransaction();
    try {
        $user2 = User::find(2);
        $user2->update(['balance' => $user2->balance - 50]);
    
        // Simulate a delay or additional work
        sleep(5);
    
        $user1 = User::find(1);
        $user1->update(['balance' => $user1->balance + 50]);
    
        DB::commit();
    } catch (\Exception $e) {
        DB::rollback();
        // Handle the exception
    }

- In this example, 
- two transactions are attempting to update the balances of two users. Each transaction first updates one user's balance and then attempts to update the other user's balance. If these two transactions run concurrently, a deadlock could occur.

## Let's break down the scenario:
- Transaction 1: Updates User 1 and then tries to update User 2.
- Transaction 2: Updates User 2 and then tries to update User 1.

## To prevent deadlocks, you can take measures such as:
- **Lock Ordering:** Ensure transactions acquire locks in a consistent order to avoid circular dependencies.
- **Lock Timeout:** Set a timeout for acquiring locks to prevent a transaction from waiting indefinitely.
- **Transaction Isolation Levels:** Choose an appropriate isolation level (e.g., READ COMMITTED) to balance between concurrency and consistency.
