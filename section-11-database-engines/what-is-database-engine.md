# Database Engine
 - is a software component that provides an interface for interacting with a database. 
 - It is responsible for managing the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data in a database system. 
 - The database engine handles tasks such as creating, updating, and deleting records, as well as ensuring data integrity and enforcing security measures.

## There are various types of database engines, and they can be broadly categorized into two main types: 
- Relational database engines 
- Non-relational (or NoSQL) database engines

1. **Relational Database Engines:**
   - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.
   - These engines use a tabular structure to organize data into tables with rows and columns.
   - They follow the principles of the relational model, which includes defining relationships between tables and using SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and manipulating data.

2. **Non-Relational Database Engines (NoSQL):**
   - Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase.
   - These engines use various data models, such as document-oriented, key-value pairs, column-family, or graph databases.
   - They are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data and offer flexibility in data storage.

- The database engine plays a crucial role in the overall performance and functionality of a database system. 
- It manages tasks like indexing, transaction management, concurrency control, and query optimization. 
- The choice of a database engine depends on the specific requirements of an application, such as scalability, data complexity, and performance considerations.
