SQLite is a software library that provides a relational database management system (RDBMS). Unlike traditional client-server database management systems, SQLite is serverless, self-contained, and embedded within the application that uses it. It is a C library that provides a lightweight, file-based database engine.

Key features of the SQLite database engine include:

1. **Serverless Architecture:**
    - SQLite is a serverless database engine, meaning that it doesn't operate as a separate process or server. Instead, it is embedded directly into the application that uses it. This simplifies deployment and eliminates the need for a separate database server.

2. **Self-Contained:**
    - SQLite databases are single ordinary files on the file system. This simplicity makes them easy to manage, copy, and move across systems.

3. **Zero Configuration:**
    - SQLite requires minimal setup and configuration. There is no need for a separate database server process, and databases are created and managed with simple file operations.

4. **Cross-Platform:**
    - SQLite is cross-platform and works on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and others. This makes it a popular choice for applications that need to run on different platforms.

5. **Transactional and ACID Compliant:**
    - SQLite supports transactions and follows the principles of ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). This ensures data integrity and reliability.

6. **Dynamic Typing:**
    - SQLite uses dynamic typing for data, allowing you to store values of any data type in any column, regardless of the declared type.

7. **Single User/Multi-User Mode:**
    - By default, SQLite operates in a single-user mode, which means that a single application has exclusive access to the database file. However, it also supports a multi-user mode where multiple applications can read from the database concurrently.

8. **Wide Adoption:**
    - SQLite is widely used in various applications, including mobile apps (both Android and iOS), desktop applications, embedded systems, and more. It is often the default choice for local storage in mobile devices.

SQLite is a popular choice for scenarios where a lightweight, embedded database is needed, and the full capabilities of a larger client-server database system are not required. While it may not be suitable for high-concurrency, high-transaction-volume scenarios typical of larger server-based databases, it is well-suited for many other use cases.
